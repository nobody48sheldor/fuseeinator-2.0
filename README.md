# FUSEEINATOR ðŸš€
to infinity and beyond ! ðŸš€
## introduction
FUSEEINATOR is a project that 1 started about a year and an half ago, the aim of the project is to launch a rocket at 200m above the ground

## code
the aim of the code was first to solve the differential equation numerically, but then I started making plot and stuff with it, and now it allows me to test differents very precise parameters

## how to run the code?
it is very easy, there is a file name python_software.py just run it like you would do with any python file, and the software should appear, from there you can run with the last settings or changes them and if you can't, open it start the file packages.bat, which should install all the used packages

## building
I think that I have an advanced enough code to know what should I build, the shape, the propellant, the size... . I should start to build it, and make tests this summer (2021).

## report
I may write a rapport about what I have done, my assomptions in the calculation, code, construction so that if someone would like to do something similar, this person would be starting with some informations
