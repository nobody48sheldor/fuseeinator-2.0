# FUSEEINATOR ðŸš€
to infinity and beyond ! ðŸš€
## introduction
FUSEEINATOR is a project that 1 started about a year and an half ago, the aim of the project is to launch a rocket at 200m above the ground

## code
the aim of the code was first to solve the differential equation numerically, but then I started making plot and stuff with it, and now it allows me to test differents very precise parameters

## how to run the code?
It is very straight forward if you just want to run the programme, there is a fuseeinator_software_2.0.exe, just run it as any programme and there you go!

But if you want the "developper" version, you can find multiple version more or less compact of it (at least similar) which are .py or .exe, but you will need to install multiple packages (if you don't have them, just run the packages.bat).

## building
I think that I have an advanced enough code to know what should I build, the shape, the propellant, the size... . I should start to build it, and make tests this summer (2021).

## report
I may write a rapport about what I have done, my assomptions in the calculation, code, construction so that if someone would like to do something similar, this person would be starting with some informations
