## introduction
FUSEEINATOR is a project that 1 started about a year and an half ago, the aim of the project is to launch a rocket at 200m above the ground

## code
the aim of the code was first to solve the differential equation numerically, but then I started making plot and stuff with it, and now it allows me to test differents very precise parameters

## building
I think that I have an advanced enough code to know what should I build, the shape, the propellant, the size... . I should start to build it, and make tests this summer (2021).

## report
I may write a rapport about what I have done, my assomptions in the calculation, code, construction so that if someone would like to do something similar, this person would be starting with some informations
